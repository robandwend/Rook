## Base

The base has been extended to fit a Mini12864 display - with a front facing Card Slot https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003004180753.html . If no display required, you could just use 4 of the rear legs.

## Mounts

Three mounts are available for an orange-pi (4 lts) a MKS Robin E3 v1.1 board (the cheaper option in the rolo's original bom) and a buck-converter (for the PI).

Note that I've moved the PI above the Robin to ease plug and card insertion. This requires the extra high offered by the base changes.

## PSU

A simple PSU box has been made to fit a 'standard?' size PSU, it connects to the frame using a simple L bracket. If you don't have the taller Base - then the connections for the bracket (or the bracket) will need changing.

## Z-Endstop

This is designed to fit a d2fc-f-7n style micro-switch (found in many PC mice). The design can be placed on any corner of the original design using a single screw. It has an adjustment hole to allow the height to changed slightly if needed.

Printing without supports is a challenge with this one, however it can be done by printing standing on its smallest end. Personally I used support-filament to make it easier.

## X-Carriage

I found the suggested screws would not fasten in enough to fully tighten the belts (bottoming out too early), so I modified the X Carriage to reduce the screw head depth by 1.5mm. This has no other affect on the part. - X_Carriage_CR10_Style(4 longer screws).stl
