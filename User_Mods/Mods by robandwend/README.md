## Base

The base has been extended to fit a Mini12864 display - with a front facing Card Slot https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003004180753.html. If no display required, you could just use 4 of the rear legs.

## Mounts

Three mounts are available for an orange-pi (4 lts) a MKS Robin E3 v1.1 board (the cheaper option in the rolo's original bom) and a buck-converter (for the PI).

Note that I've moved the PI above the Robin to ease plug and card insertion. This requires the extra high offered by the base changes.

## PSU

A simple PSU box has been made to fit a 'standard?' size PSU, it connects to the frame using a simple L bracket. If you don't have the taller Base - then the connections for the bracket (or the bracket) will need changing.
